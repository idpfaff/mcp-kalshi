## 📖 Overview

The Kalshi MCP Server enables AI agents to interact with [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com), a regulated prediction market exchange in the US. This server provides comprehensive access to market data, real-time pricing, order books, portfolio management, and trading capabilities.

By implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP), this server allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover prediction markets, analyze odds (probabilities), execute trades, and track portfolio performance directly through their context window, bridging the gap between AI and regulated prediction markets.

## ✨ Features

*   **Market Discovery**: Search and filter prediction markets by status, series, or event keywords.
*   **Real-time Pricing**: Access live price data, implied probabilities, and depth-of-market (order books) for any market.
*   **Portfolio Tracking**: Monitor account balance, positions, trade history, fills, and settlements.
*   **Trading Operations**: Place limit or market orders, cancel orders, and manage positions.

## 📦 Installation

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

Your RSA private key is used to sign API requests. Here's what you need to know:

**Your Key Stays Safe:**
- The MCP server runs entirely on your local machine
- Your private key never leaves your computer
- No data is sent to any third-party servers except Kalshi's official API

**Important Security Practices:**
- Never commit your private key to version control
- Never share your configuration file containing the key path
- Only use this on trusted, secure machines
